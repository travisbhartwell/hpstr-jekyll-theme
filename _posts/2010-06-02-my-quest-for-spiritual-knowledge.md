> The greatest achievement mankind can make in this world is to familiarize themselves with divine truth, so thoroughly, so perfectly, that the example or conduct of no creature living in the world can ever turn them away from the knowledge that they have obtained. "In the footsteps of the Master" ... is the safest and surest course to pursue. ... We can absorb the precepts, the doctrines and the divine word of the Master, without any fear that the exemplar will fail of carrying [them] out. ...
>
> From my boyhood I have desired to learn the principles of the gospel in such a way and to such an extent that it would matter not to me who might fall from the truth, ... who might fail to continue to follow the example of the Master, my foundation would be sure and certain in the truths that I have learned. ...
>
> I know of but One in all the world who can be taken as the first and only perfect standard for us to follow, and he is the Only Begotten Son of God.

I struggled to come up with the best quote from Elder Richard G. Scott's speech "Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge" to capture the essence of why I am sharing this treasure.  Essentially, I am embarking on my own spiritual journey, a renewal, and an attempt to gain understanding of my place and path in this world.

I hope to share talks, speeches, articles, scripture passages, and book summaries containing ideas that are influencing me.  I hope that I can get ideas and comments so that my understanding of the basic, core principles of life may increase and perhaps I too can help someone else in this journey.
