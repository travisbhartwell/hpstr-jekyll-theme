Though not directly a spiritual thing, I'm sharing this because I am starting to believe my interactions with technology (particularly over the last decade) have fundamentally rewired my brain and not necessarily in a good way.

In this moment of deep introspection and self-examination, I realize to become who I truly desire, I need to fundamentally alter how I use and interact with technology. Yes, I love technology. It is a fundamental part of my life and that will not change. But I think the place it plays in my life should change.
