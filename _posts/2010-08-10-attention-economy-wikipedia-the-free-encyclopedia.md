I like especially the portion where Mr. Simon says “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”. This is a good description of many of my habits in using technology.

As a software developer (more precisely, a software tool developer), I’m particularly interested in his recommendation that “what was really needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or irrelevant information.” How can I better filter out information and yet take advantage of the wealth available? Good thoughts to ponder.
