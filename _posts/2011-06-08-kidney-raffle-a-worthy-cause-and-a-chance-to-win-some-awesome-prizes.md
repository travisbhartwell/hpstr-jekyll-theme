I just made a small donation to help [Cath Duncan](http://twitter.com/cathduncan) and the rest of [Team Juggernaut](http://www.facebook.com/TeamJuggernaut) raise [\$45K](http://kidneyraffle.com/goal/) to help fund kidney research.

Please, I urge you to [go and donate](http://kidneyraffle.com/) whatever you can spare. It will help the quality of life of millions of people, myself included.

My donation today is in honor of [all of those that have helped me]({{ site.url }}/2011/03/11/world-kidney-day-and-a-special-thanks/) through my kidney disease and transplant. In particular, in honor of Ann Henson who donated one of her kidneys to me, nearly two years ago on June 19, 2009:

Finally, a special shout-out to [Jenny Blake](http://www.lifeaftercollege.org/), a great friend of my sister’s, who is contributing to this great cause as the author of “Life After College”. It means so much to me, and I’m glad I found out about this great event through you, Jenny!
