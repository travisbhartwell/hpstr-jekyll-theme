I may be going blind  
and the darkness encroaching from all sides.  
But at least with clarity  
now I see all directly in front of me  
No longer the periphery is important  
this I must finally accept  
When looking straight forward  
I see me, reflected right back.  
In this mirror, I see the hurt and the pain and the exhaustion  
all reflected so clearly in what is before me.  
But also sometimes the clouds move  
and the sun shines, revealing what is inside.  
That glory, those heaven-sent photons  
hit my heart with a whisper  
I open my heart to finally hear  
and I am lifted to that higher place  
Elevated, I see that which is reflected back,  
that right in front of me.  
Different from before is what my dim eyes see  
higher, noble, good, beautiful.  
Suddenly, as if I’ve found just one last breath,  
the exhaustion sets in.  
My vision falls  
but I hold it in my heart, a little spark.  
Even when it feels I cannot rise to those lofty heights of grandeur  
no longer one day I will see  
So clearly, the light I see right in front of me  
won’t be reflected back to me, but reality.
