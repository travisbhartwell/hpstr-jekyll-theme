I created a quick screencast the other day.  It was an introduction to [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/), a starter kit or configuration for Emacs, that is self-proclaimed as an "Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil: The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!".  In this screencast, I cover installation, showing installation in an Ubuntu 15.04 virtual machine.

All that is required is Gnus Emacs 24 and git.

Feel free to check out my [Spacemacs configuration](https://gitlab.com/travisbhartwell/vcsh_emacs/tree/master).  Reach out on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/travisbhartwell) if you have any questions.

I hope to make some more of these soon, about Spacemacs and perhaps other topics.
